# Chalk UI
Chalk UI is a lightweight UI Engine built atop SFML. It is wrin entirely C++, and is in active development.
It uses a system of inheritence in which every object has a parent, object containers can hold children. The Workspace object is the root of inheritence.
# Project Setup
Because the Chalk UI relies on SFML for graphics functionality, you will have to install SFML 2.6 or later.
Once you have installed SFML, some of the properties of your solution will need to modified:
- C++ Language Standard: ISO C++ 20 Standard
- Additional Include Directories: (installation directory)\CHALK_UI\Chalk-UI\
# Notes
- Chalk UI has basic audio functionality provided by FMOD Engine 2.02 - a propertiary software.
- If you include Audio.h in your project, you will need to purchase a license from FMOD (https://www.fmod.com/) before it is published.
- This project is still in it's infancy, some features are unpolished and there is much planned for future versions.
# Documentation
Proper Documentation is not available because Chalk UI was just released, but it is in the works.
